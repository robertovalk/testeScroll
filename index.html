                    <p>Totodile is a bipedal, crocodilian Pokémon with well-developed jaws. It has red eyes with ridges above them, black markings around its eyes, and several sharp teeth. On its chest is a yellow, V-shaped marking that extends to its arms; there is a thin line through the center of the marking. Totodile has five fingers and three toes. Down its back is a row of three red spines with a small, red ridge on either side. The tip of its tail has a single red spine as well. Totodile tends to be playful by nature and has a habit of biting anything it sees, including its Trainer. However, its jaws are capable of crushing anything, so it sometimes causes serious injuries. Totodile is scarce in the wild, though it can be found around bodies of water like rivers, ponds, and lakes.</p>

Its rounded head has three blunt horns extending above its forehead, and eyes with dark yellow pupils. Scizor's thin, black neck connects to a black, teardrop-shaped patch on its thorax. Scizor has broad shoulders and thin, segmented arms ending in large, round pincers, which make up a third of Scizor's body weight. Scizor has a large, rounded abdomen with three black, chevron-shaped stripes extending from its waist down its front; female Scizor have larger abdomens than male Scizor. Scizor's legs are defined by large hip joints, thin thighs, and wide calves, and its feet end in a clawed toe on each side.</p>

                    <p>Heracross is a bipedal, coleopteran insectoid Pokémon covered in a blue exoskeleton. There is a long, pronged horn on its forehead. The horn ends in a cross on males and a heart-shape on females. On either side of the horn is a short antenna with a spherical tip. Heracross has oval, yellow eyes. Its forearms have a pair of spikes near the wrists, while its thighs have a single spike each. It has two claws on its hands, and a single long claw on each foot. There is a single pair of wings covered by elytra, which can be seen during its release from a Poké Ball in the 3D games. Heracross's claws allow it to dig into the ground for sturdy footing and also allow it to climb trees. Using its horn, it throws opponents or competitors for food. It can lift and throw objects 100 times its own weight. It uses its two antennae to search for food by scent. It lives in boreal, temperate, and tropical forests, where it feeds on tree sap. In Generation II, Megahorn was its signature move.</p>
